Obstacle and Solution
Originally the vast amount of newspaper articles that we were given was overwhelming. We did not know where to begin or how to find information relevant to our problem. Eventually we decided to construct a basic search engine to find articles relevant to a "laboratory." This helped us identify key players and events which gave us the foundation on which to build our hypotheses.

Reflections on Improving Our Approach We Redid HW01
When we started the assignment, our first step was to look for a visualization that we could produce. Without a thorough understanding of the situation from reading the newspaper articles creating a final project proved impossible. Next time, we will begin by attempting to familiarize ourselves with the data as thoroughly as possible before attempting to construct hypotheses and visualizations.
